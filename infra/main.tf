# RepSignal - demo infrastructure (NOT APPLIED)
#
# This is a minimal, illustrative Terraform config that would host the built
# web dashboard (apps/web/dist) as a static site on an AWS S3 bucket. It is a
# DEMO artifact: it has never been applied, no state is committed, and applying
# it would create real, billable AWS resources. See infra/README.md.
